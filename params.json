{"name":"PiXLGEN","tagline":"BitGlass's Game Development Kit","body":"## Welcome to PiXLGEN.\r\nPiXLGEN (Pixel Generator, or pixlgen) is a brand new, fully featured game engine currently in development by BitGlass. Today, it powers BitGlass's very own game, [Paticon](https://paticon.com). PiXLGEN currently targets Windows, Mac OS X (with web environments for both), iOS and Android (our next goal is Windows Phone). So that means support for both DirectX (9.0 & 11) and OpenGL. And the best part is that everything is totally native.\r\n\r\n### A quick introduction\r\nThe truth is, PiXLGEN isn't just a game engine. It's 4 seperate components, that _together_, create a rather nicley featured and furnished game enviorment. Want to meet them?\r\n\r\n#### The Components\r\n1. **PiXLCode** - is the recommeneded \"scripting\" language for use with PiXLGEN. You aren't required to use it though. Syntax wise, it's almost identical to Java. Except for that they have nothing in common. Unlike the other components, PiXLCode is totally separate and you can create regular applications with it if you want to. Why would you? You'll see in a bit.\r\n2. **PiXLSpace** - is the entire world. And everything in it. This include the world-space, all of 3D objects (i.e. the meshes), the 2D planes, the environment, the cameras, sound sources and so on.\r\n3. **PiXLDraw** - is the rendering pipeline. It does the mapping, texturing, shading, and all of the other necessary things to render a frame. It is very tightly integrated with PiXLSpace and has support for native Compute Shaders on the GPU!\r\n4. **PiXLPlay** - is the runtime environment. Pure PiXLCode does not require it, as it compiles into native binaries, but it provides some nice stuff like NVidia PhysX, Time, a GUI toolkit and more. \r\n\r\nNow, each of these components has their own repo and is treated as a separate project. PiXLGEN just ties everything together really nicely _and_ include a pretty awesome editor. More about that in a moment.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
